Version 1.0.1 Re-exported the maps from DungeonDraft with a lower quality. The actual quality in play is barely noticable but it reduces the size of the book 1 maps from around 350MB for all of them down to 94MB. I also removed the DungeonDraft grid from the maps so that people can use their own grid or no grid if they like. Furthermore, I tweaked a coupe of maps as well as added Forest Battle which I forgot to make a scene for in version 1.0.0

My FOTRP map remakes for Pathfinder 2nd Edition

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. I am a player in FOTRP so I can only make maps at the rate we play on them or what my GM is comfortable with sharing ahead of time.
As of 2023-03-26 now I have finished the maps for Book 1, but as my group has not finished Book 1 yet, Book 2 maps will probably be a ways off.

This is a map remake of the adventures from the Fists of the Ruby Phoenix souce book created by Paizo. You can buy the book here https://paizo.com/products/btq02eca?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Fists-of-the-Ruby-Phoenix It does not have any of the content besides remade maps, you will need to own the book to be able to run the adventure path.

I have also taken artistic liberty with some of the maps in the book as I did not have a great way to recreate some of them in DungeonDraft. I have also created lots of new generic battlemaps for use during the island portion of the book such as a beach, a cave, a mountain pass, a plains and a forest.

Maps are usually 100x100 pixels.

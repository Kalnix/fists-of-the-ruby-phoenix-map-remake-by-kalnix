Version 1.1.1 Updated a book 1 map with tiles and macros to move those tiles into position. You can find the macros in the Macro Folder at the bottom of the screen near the currently logged in users and the macro bar.

Version 1.1.0 My group finished the titualar Danger Island and as such the GM told me some secrets we missed and that I have had to update in the maps including changing some walling. I have also fixed an issue where I deleted water on one of the maps by mistake last release. Finally, more tweaks to shadows.

Version 1.0.2 Fixed some path issues and converted the Hex map from a PNG to a webp. This plus the changes made in 1.0.1 reduced the size of the map pack from 350MB to now 67.5MB with very minimal loss in quality. Also very slight tweak to River Site.

Version 1.0.1 Re-exported the maps from DungeonDraft with a lower quality. The actual quality in play is barely noticable but it reduces the size of the book 1 maps from around 350MB for all of them down to 94MB. I also removed the DungeonDraft grid from the maps so that people can use their own grid or no grid if they like. Furthermore, I tweaked a coupe of maps as well as added Forest Battle which I forgot to make a scene for in version 1.0.0

My FOTRP map remakes for Pathfinder 2nd Edition

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. I am a player in FOTRP so I can only make maps at the rate we play on them or what my GM is comfortable with sharing ahead of time.
As of 2023-03-26 now I have finished the maps for Book 1, but as my group has not finished Book 1 yet, Book 2 maps will probably be a ways off.

This is a map remake of the adventures from the Fists of the Ruby Phoenix souce book created by Paizo. You can buy the book here https://paizo.com/products/btq02eca?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Fists-of-the-Ruby-Phoenix It does not have any of the content besides remade maps, you will need to own the book to be able to run the adventure path.

I have also taken artistic liberty with some of the maps in the book as I did not have a great way to recreate some of them in DungeonDraft. I have also created lots of new generic battlemaps for use during the island portion of the book such as a beach, a cave, a mountain pass, a plains and a forest.

Maps are usually 100x100 pixels.

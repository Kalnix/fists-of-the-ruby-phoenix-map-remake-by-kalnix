My FOTRP make remakes for Pathfinder 2nd Edition

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. I am a player in FOTRP so I can only make maps at the rate we play on them or what my GM is comfortable with sharing ahead of time.
I might turn this into a FoundryVTT module at some point but that would be far in the future when we have at least finished book 1. For now I have JSON files for the maps which you should be able to import and then give it the path to the right image.

This is a map remake of the adventures from the Fists of the Ruby Phoenix souce book created by Paizo. You can buy the book here https://paizo.com/products/btq02eca?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Fists-of-the-Ruby-Phoenix It does not have any of the content besides remade maps, you will need to own the book to be able to run the adventure path.

I have also taken artistic liberty with some of the maps in the book as I did not have a great way to recreate some of them in DungeonDraft. I have also created lots of new generic battlemaps for use during the island portion of the book such as a beach, a cave, a mountain pass, a plains and a forest.

Maps are usually 100x100 pixels.

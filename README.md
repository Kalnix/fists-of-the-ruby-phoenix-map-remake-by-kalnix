My FOTRP make remakes for Pathfinder 2nd Edition

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. I am a player in FOTRP so I can only make maps at the rate we play on them or what my GM is comfortable with sharing ahead of time.

This is a map remake of the adventures from the Fists of the Ruby Phoenix souce book created by Paizo. You can buy the book here https://paizo.com/products/btq02eca?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Fists-of-the-Ruby-Phoenix It does not have any of the content besides remade maps, you will need to own the book to be able to run the adventure path.

Maps are usually 100x100 pixels.

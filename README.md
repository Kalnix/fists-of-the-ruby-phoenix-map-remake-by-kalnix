Version 1.2.0 About half of the maps for book 2 added. All of the maps for chapter 1 and a couple for later chapters.

My FOTRP map remakes for Pathfinder 2nd Edition

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. I am a player in FOTRP so I can only make maps at the rate we play on them or what my GM is comfortable with sharing ahead of time.
As of 2023-06-14 I am about 60% done with the maps for book 2 according to my GM but at least all of the maps needed for chapter 1 is complete.

This is a map remake of the adventures from the Fists of the Ruby Phoenix souce book created by Paizo. You can buy the book here https://paizo.com/products/btq02eca?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Fists-of-the-Ruby-Phoenix It does not have any of the content besides remade maps, you will need to own the book to be able to run the adventure path.

I have also taken artistic liberty with some of the maps in the book as I did not have a great way to recreate some of them in DungeonDraft. I have also created lots of new generic battlemaps for use during the island portion of the book such as a beach, a cave, a mountain pass, a plains and a forest.

Maps are usually 100x100 pixels.
